# SmartCap: Vision for the visually impaired

Smart Cap is an assistant for the visually impaired that is designed to narrate the description of a scene via pictures from a webcam.
The Smart Cap aims to bring the world as a narrative to the visually impaired. This narrative is generated by converting the scenes in front of the person to text, which describes the important objects in the scene. Examples of text include “a group of people playing a game of baseball”, “a yellow truck parked next to the car”, or “a bowl of salad on a table”
